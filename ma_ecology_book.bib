Together, these elements comprise a PICO frame. Although this framework was developed to facilitate the formulation of clinical queries, the ability of PICO structures to represent physicians’ information needs has not been empirically investigated. This paper evaluates the adequacy and suitability of PICO frames as a knowledge representation by analyzing 59 real-world primary-care clinical questions. We discovered that only two questions in our corpus contain all four PICO elements, and that 37\% of questions contain both intervention and outcome. Our study reveals prevalent structural patterns for the four types of clinical questions: therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, and etiology. We found that the PICO framework is primarily centered on therapy questions, and is less suitable for representing other types of clinical information needs. Challenges in mapping natural language questions into PICO structures are also discussed. Although we point out limitations of the PICO framework, our work as a whole reaffirms its value as a tool to assist physicians practicing EBM.},

	abstract = {Australia has diverse landscapes ranging from wet tropical regions in the North to temperate regions in the South and a vast arid interior. This variety has given rise to not only a speciose bat fauna, but also a variety of wetland ecosystems. The relationship between bats and wetlands is inﬂuenced by a range of environmental gradients including: aridity and climate variability, hydrological, structural, productivity and salinity. However, little is known about how these gradients inﬂuence bats in Australian wetland systems. Our aim was to determine whether wetlands were important for Australia’s bat communities, identify the environmental gradients inﬂuencing this importance, and review the threats to wetland bat communities combining a review and meta-analysis. We reviewed the literature on bats within wetland ecosystems in six ecoregions (arid, semi-arid ﬂoodplain, temperate, tropics, estuarine/saline and urban) in Australia. We used a meta-analysis to estimate relative wetland importance across ecoregions by calculating the eﬀect size of the diﬀerence in bat activity between 43 paired wet and dry habitats. Bats were signiﬁcantly more active in wet than surrounding dry habitats in arid and semi-arid ﬂoodplain. Urban wetlands also hosted greater bat activity than surrounding dry areas in 4 out of 7 sites. Wetlands were generally less important for bats in warm, wet tropical areas, and more important for bats in dry landscapes where landscape woody cover and productivity were low. Relative to dry areas within each region assessed, wetlands were most important for bats in semi-arid ﬂoodplain and urban regions. These regions are also under greatest threats from vegetation clearing, modiﬁcation of ﬂow regimes, development pressures, pollution and climate change.},

              and future biodiversity loss that is occurring due to human
              disturbances. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of
              experimental and observational studies that report 327 measures
              of change in species richness between disturbed and undisturbed
              habitats across both terrestrial and aquatic biomes. On average,
              human-mediated disturbances lead to an 18.3\% decline in species
              richness. Declines in species richness were highest for
              endotherms (33.2\%), followed by producers (25.1\%), and
              ectotherms (10.5\%). Land-use change and species invasions had
              the largest impact on species richness resulting in a 24.8\% and
              23.7\% decline, respectively, followed by habitat loss (14\%),
              nutrient addition (8.2\%), and increases in temperature (3.6\%).
              Across all disturbances, declines in species richness were
              greater for terrestrial biomes (22.4\%) than aquatic biomes
              (5.9\%). In the tropics, habitat loss and land-use change had the

  author   = "Cameron, E K and Vil{\`a}, M and Cabeza, M",
  abstract = "Aim Terrestrial invertebrates comprise a large proportion of
              alien species world-wide, yet a quantitative global synthesis of
              their effects on native species and ecosystems has not been
              explored. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the ecological
              impacts of terrestrial invertebrate invaders and to test how
              impacts are modulated by the invader's trophic position, habitat
              attributes (i.e. insularity and disturbance) and the study
              methodology (observational versus experimental). LocationGlobal.
              MethodsWe investigated the effects of terrestrial invertebrate
              invaders on populations, communities and ecosystems by conducting
              a random effects meta-analysis using 112 articles reporting data
              from 710 field and laboratory studies. The analysis included 16
              insect, 11 earthworm, 7 slug and 1 nematode invaders. Results On
              average, across invaders, the presence of invaders reduced plant
              fitness (52\%), animal diversity (33\%) and animal abundance
              (29\%). Leaf litter decomposition was 41\% higher in the presence
              of invaders, while other ecosystem-level variables such as
              nutrient cycling were not affected in a consistent direction.
              Invasive predators and detritivores decreased animal abundance,
              whereas herbivores and omnivores had limited impacts. Single
              invaders increased soil nitrogen pools while multiple species did
              not. Insularity and disturbance did not affect the magnitude of
              the impacts significantly, mainly because there was a large
              variation among studies. Main conclusionsOverall, our study
              indicates that terrestrial invertebrate invaders have significant
              consistent effects on populations, communities and ecosystems,
              with islands and disturbed sites not being more prone to impacts.
              However, effects vary considerably depending on the type of
              impact being examined and the trophic position of the invader.
              There is no evidence that invaders cause larger impacts when
              multiple species of invaders, rather than single invaders, are
              involved.",

  abstract = "Meta-analysis is often used to compare how soil health differs
              between organic and conventional farming systems. However, the
              burgeoning primary literature on organic farming now allows
              direct evaluation of the best management practices (BMPs) within
              organic farming systems on soil health improvements. Therefore,
              the main objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the
              effect of BMPs, such as organic amendments, conservation tillage,
              and cover cropping, on soil health within organic farming
              systems. We focused on two principal soil health metrics: soil
              organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC)
              concentrations. On average, adoption of BMPs increased
              depth-weighted SOC and MBC concentrations by 18 and 30 \%,
              respectively, relative to organically-managed control groups.
              Among BMPs, organic amendments and conservation tillage practices
              showed net positive effect on soil health with 24 and 14 \%
              increase in depth-weighted SOC concentrations, respectively.
              Although cover cropping did not have an overall influence on SOC
              concentrations, we found a temporal trend such that cover
              cropping significantly increased SOC concentrations after 5 years
              of its adoption. This indicates that the soil health benefits
              from BMPs accrue over time and highlights the need of long-term
              adoptability of BMPs to achieve agricultural sustainability.
              Future primary articles that focus on under-researched cropping
              practices in organic systems (e.g., crop rotation length and
              diversity, biochar addition) and the additive effects of multiple
              BMPs on soil health, will add to the synthesizable evidence base.
              Therefore, this meta-analysis confirms the soil health benefits
              of adopting BMPs within organic farming systems, identifies
              critical knowledge gaps, and provides directions for future
              organic farming research.",

              through a meta-analysis. The general impact of microplastic
              exposure on the functional traits of fishes and specifically on
              eight variables, namely, behaviour, development, fecundity,
              feeding, growth, health, hatching and survival was explored.
              Subgroup analyses were performed to detect correlations between
              the impact of microplastics and the following factors: species,
              life stage, habitat, water column habitat, day of exposure to
              microplastics and microplastic size, type and shape. A
              meta-regression analysis allowed understanding the correlation
              between the impact of microplastics and the size of organisms.
              Generally, microplastics have a negative effect on the functional
              traits of fishes. Feeding and behaviour, followed by growth
              showed the greatest impact. Among the subgroup analysis, four of

              meta-analysis",
  author   = "Sohn, Julia A and Saha, Somidh and Bauhus, J{\"u}rgen",
  abstract = "Increasing frequency of extremely dry and hot summers in some
              regions emphasise the need for silvicultural approaches to
              increase the drought tolerance of existing forests in the short
              term, before long-term adaptation through species changes may be
              possible. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the
              potential of thinning for improving tree performance during and
              after drought. We used results from 23 experiments that employed
              different thinning intensities including an unthinned control and
              focused on the response variables: radial growth, carbon- and
              oxygen-isotopes in tree-rings and pre-dawn leaf-water potential.
              We found that thinning effects on the growth response to drought
              differed between broadleaves and conifers, although these
              findings are based on few studies only in broadleaved forests.
              Thinning helped to mitigate growth reductions during drought in
              broadleaves, most likely via increases of soil water
              availability. In contrast, in conifers, comparable
              drought-related growth reductions and increases of water-use
              efficiency were observed in all treatments but thinning improved
              the post-drought recovery and resilience of radial growth.
              Results of meta-regression analysis indicate that benefits of
              both moderate and heavy thinning for growth performance following
              drought (recovery and resilience) decrease with time since the
              last intervention. Further, growth resistance during drought
              became smaller with stand age while the rate of growth recovery
              following drought increased over time irrespective of treatment.
              Heavy but not moderate thinning helped to avoid an age-related
              decline in medium-term growth resilience to drought. For both
              closed and very open stands, growth performance during drought
              improved with increasing site aridity but for the same stands
              growth recovery and resilience following drought was reduced with
              increasing site aridity. This synthesis of experiments from a
              wide geographical range has demonstrated that thinning, in
              particular heavy thinning, is a suitable approach to improve the
              growth response of remaining trees to drought in both conifers
              and broadleaves but the underlying processes differ and need to
              be considered.",

              meta-analysis of studies reporting the effects of these forest
              changes on litter decomposition in streams. Overall, forest
              change significantly inhibited litter decomposition rate by ca
              18\%. However, only the replacement of native forests by
              deciduous broadleaf or eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus)
              plantations resulted in significant inhibition of litter
              decomposition (26\% and 22\%, respectively) whereas conifer
              plantations or the invasion by exotic species did not
              significantly affect litter decomposition. The replacement of
              native forests by eucalyptus plantations was the most common type
              of forest change in our database. The effect of eucalyptus
              plantations on litter decomposition was significant when they
              were present simultaneously at the catchment and riparian scales
              and when native litter input was replaced by eucalyptus litter
              input in a manipulative experiment at the stream reach level.
              This suggests that a strong effect of eucalyptus plantations on
              ecosystem functioning is mediated by changes on litter inputs to
              streams. Eucalyptus plantations significantly inhibited the
              decomposition of high quality litter and total leaf litter
              decomposition but not the decomposition of wood and low quality
              leaves, or microbial-driven leaf litter decomposition. This
              indicates that eucalyptus plantations inhibit (likely through
              changes in litter inputs) litter decomposition by affecting
              detritivores. Eucalyptus plantations may thus have stronger
              negative effects on decomposition rates in streams receiving high
              quality litter and where detritivores are abundant. The presence
              of native tree species in the riparian area may mitigate the
              negative effects of eucalyptus plantations on stream processes.
              The inhibitory effect of deciduous broadleaf plantations on
              litter decomposition was likely due to beech (Fagus sylvatica)
              being used in the majority of the plantations, and beech litter
              is of low quality for detritivores and decomposers. The lack of
              significant effects of conifer plantations and invasions might be
              due to contrasting effects of the different conifer or invasive
              species on decomposers. This meta-analysis also identified
              several research gaps that may guide future studies on the effect

              Vermicomposting is a process whereby earthworms transform organic
              residues into compost that can be used as a substrate for plant
              growth. Many studies have evaluated the effect of vermicompost on

              quantitative summary of the effect size of vermicompost on plant
              growth. We found that vermicompost brought about average
              increases of 26\% in commercial yield, 13\% in total biomass,
              78\% in shoot biomass, and 57\% in root biomass. The positive
              effect of vermicompost on plant growth reached a maximum when
              vermicompost represented 30 to 50\% of the soil volume. The best
              original material to be used for vermicompost production was
              cattle manure. The effect was stronger when no fertilizer was
              added, and lower when the standard Metro-Mix 360 substratum

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: To identify and appraise empirical studies on
              publication and related biases published since 1998; to assess
              methods to deal with publication and related biases; and to
              examine, in a random sample of published systematic reviews,
              measures taken to prevent, reduce and detect dissemination bias.
              DATA SOURCES: The main literature search, in August 2008, covered
              the Cochrane Methodology Register Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED
              and CINAHL. In May 2009, PubMed, PsycINFO and OpenSIGLE were also
              searched. Reference lists of retrieved studies were also
              examined. REVIEW METHODS: In Part I, studies were classified as
              evidence or method studies and data were extracted according to
              types of dissemination bias or methods for dealing with it.
              Evidence from empirical studies was summarised narratively. In
              Part II, 300 systematic reviews were randomly selected from
              MEDLINE and the methods used to deal with publication and related
              biases were assessed. RESULTS: Studies with significant or
              positive results were more likely to be published than those with
              non-significant or negative results, thereby confirming findings
              from a previous HTA report. There was convincing evidence that
              outcome reporting bias exists and has an impact on the pooled
              summary in systematic reviews. Studies with significant results
              tended to be published earlier than studies with non-significant
              results, and empirical evidence suggests that published studies
              tended to report a greater treatment effect than those from the
              grey literature. Exclusion of non-English-language studies
              appeared to result in a high risk of bias in some areas of
              research such as complementary and alternative medicine. In a few
              cases, publication and related biases had a potentially
              detrimental impact on patients or resource use. Publication bias
              can be prevented before a literature review (e.g. by prospective
              registration of trials), or detected during a literature review
              (e.g. by locating unpublished studies, funnel plot and related
              tests, sensitivity analysis modelling), or its impact can be
              minimised after a literature review (e.g. by confirmatory
              large-scale trials, updating the systematic review). The
              interpretation of funnel plot and related statistical tests,
              often used to assess publication bias, was often too simplistic
              and likely misleading. More sophisticated modelling methods have
              not been widely used. Compared with systematic reviews published
              in 1996, recent reviews of health-care interventions were more
              likely to locate and include non-English-language studies and
              grey literature or unpublished studies, and to test for
              publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Dissemination of research findings
              is likely to be a biased process, although the actual impact of
              such bias depends on specific circumstances. The prospective
              registration of clinical trials and the endorsement of reporting
              guidelines may reduce research dissemination bias in clinical
              research. In systematic reviews, measures can be taken to
              minimise the impact of dissemination bias by systematically
              searching for and including relevant studies that are difficult
              to access. Statistical methods can be useful for sensitivity
              analyses. Further research is needed to develop methods for
              qualitatively assessing the risk of publication bias in
              systematic reviews, and to evaluate the effect of prospective
              registration of studies, open access policy and improved
              publication guidelines.",

  abstract = "Asymmetry in funnel plots may indicate publication bias in
              meta-analysis, but the shape of the plot in the absence of bias
              depends on the choice of axes. We evaluated standard error,
              precision (inverse of standard error), variance, inverse of
              variance, sample size and log sample size (vertical axis) and log
              odds ratio, log risk ratio and risk difference (horizontal axis).
              Standard error is likely to be the best choice for the vertical
              axis: the expected shape in the absence of bias corresponds to a
              symmetrical funnel, straight lines to indicate 95\% confidence
              intervals can be included and the plot emphasises smaller studies
              which are more prone to bias. Precision or inverse of variance is
              useful when comparing meta-analyses of small trials with
              subsequent large trials. The use of sample size or log sample
              size is problematic because the expected shape of the plot in the
              absence of bias is unpredictable. We found similar evidence for
              asymmetry and between trial variation in a sample of 78 published
              meta-analyses whether odds ratios or risk ratios were used on the
              horizontal axis. Different conclusions were reached for risk
              differences and this was related to increased between-trial
              variation. We conclude that funnel plots of meta-analyses should
              generally use standard error as the measure of study size and
              ratio measures of treatment effect. \copyright{} 2001 Elsevier
