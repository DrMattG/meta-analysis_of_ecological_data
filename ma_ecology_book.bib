Together, these elements comprise a PICO frame. Although this framework was developed to facilitate the formulation of clinical queries, the ability of PICO structures to represent physicians’ information needs has not been empirically investigated. This paper evaluates the adequacy and suitability of PICO frames as a knowledge representation by analyzing 59 real-world primary-care clinical questions. We discovered that only two questions in our corpus contain all four PICO elements, and that 37\% of questions contain both intervention and outcome. Our study reveals prevalent structural patterns for the four types of clinical questions: therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, and etiology. We found that the PICO framework is primarily centered on therapy questions, and is less suitable for representing other types of clinical information needs. Challenges in mapping natural language questions into PICO structures are also discussed. Although we point out limitations of the PICO framework, our work as a whole reaffirms its value as a tool to assist physicians practicing EBM.},

	abstract = {Australia has diverse landscapes ranging from wet tropical regions in the North to temperate regions in the South and a vast arid interior. This variety has given rise to not only a speciose bat fauna, but also a variety of wetland ecosystems. The relationship between bats and wetlands is inﬂuenced by a range of environmental gradients including: aridity and climate variability, hydrological, structural, productivity and salinity. However, little is known about how these gradients inﬂuence bats in Australian wetland systems. Our aim was to determine whether wetlands were important for Australia’s bat communities, identify the environmental gradients inﬂuencing this importance, and review the threats to wetland bat communities combining a review and meta-analysis. We reviewed the literature on bats within wetland ecosystems in six ecoregions (arid, semi-arid ﬂoodplain, temperate, tropics, estuarine/saline and urban) in Australia. We used a meta-analysis to estimate relative wetland importance across ecoregions by calculating the eﬀect size of the diﬀerence in bat activity between 43 paired wet and dry habitats. Bats were signiﬁcantly more active in wet than surrounding dry habitats in arid and semi-arid ﬂoodplain. Urban wetlands also hosted greater bat activity than surrounding dry areas in 4 out of 7 sites. Wetlands were generally less important for bats in warm, wet tropical areas, and more important for bats in dry landscapes where landscape woody cover and productivity were low. Relative to dry areas within each region assessed, wetlands were most important for bats in semi-arid ﬂoodplain and urban regions. These regions are also under greatest threats from vegetation clearing, modiﬁcation of ﬂow regimes, development pressures, pollution and climate change.},

  abstract = "There is high uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of current
              and future biodiversity loss that is occurring due to human
              disturbances. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of
              experimental and observational studies that report 327 measures
              of change in species richness between disturbed and undisturbed
              habitats across both terrestrial and aquatic biomes. On average,
              human-mediated disturbances lead to an 18.3\% decline in species
              richness. Declines in species richness were highest for
              endotherms (33.2\%), followed by producers (25.1\%), and
              ectotherms (10.5\%). Land-use change and species invasions had
              the largest impact on species richness resulting in a 24.8\% and
              23.7\% decline, respectively, followed by habitat loss (14\%),
              nutrient addition (8.2\%), and increases in temperature (3.6\%).
              Across all disturbances, declines in species richness were
              greater for terrestrial biomes (22.4\%) than aquatic biomes
              (5.9\%). In the tropics, habitat loss and land-use change had the
              largest impact on species richness, whereas in the boreal forest
              and Northern temperate forests, species invasions had the largest

  author   = "Cameron, E K and Vil{\`a}, M and Cabeza, M",
  abstract = "Aim Terrestrial invertebrates comprise a large proportion of
              alien species world-wide, yet a quantitative global synthesis of
              their effects on native species and ecosystems has not been
              explored. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the ecological
              impacts of terrestrial invertebrate invaders and to test how
              impacts are modulated by the invader's trophic position, habitat
              attributes (i.e. insularity and disturbance) and the study
              methodology (observational versus experimental). LocationGlobal.
              MethodsWe investigated the effects of terrestrial invertebrate
              invaders on populations, communities and ecosystems by conducting
              a random effects meta-analysis using 112 articles reporting data
              from 710 field and laboratory studies. The analysis included 16
              insect, 11 earthworm, 7 slug and 1 nematode invaders. Results On
              average, across invaders, the presence of invaders reduced plant
              fitness (52\%), animal diversity (33\%) and animal abundance
              (29\%). Leaf litter decomposition was 41\% higher in the presence
              of invaders, while other ecosystem-level variables such as
              nutrient cycling were not affected in a consistent direction.
              Invasive predators and detritivores decreased animal abundance,
              whereas herbivores and omnivores had limited impacts. Single
              invaders increased soil nitrogen pools while multiple species did
              not. Insularity and disturbance did not affect the magnitude of
              the impacts significantly, mainly because there was a large
              variation among studies. Main conclusionsOverall, our study
              indicates that terrestrial invertebrate invaders have significant
              consistent effects on populations, communities and ecosystems,
              with islands and disturbed sites not being more prone to impacts.
              However, effects vary considerably depending on the type of
              impact being examined and the trophic position of the invader.
              There is no evidence that invaders cause larger impacts when
              multiple species of invaders, rather than single invaders, are
              involved.",

              burgeoning primary literature on organic farming now allows
              direct evaluation of the best management practices (BMPs) within
              organic farming systems on soil health improvements. Therefore,
              the main objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the
              effect of BMPs, such as organic amendments, conservation tillage,
              and cover cropping, on soil health within organic farming
              systems. We focused on two principal soil health metrics: soil
              organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC)
              concentrations. On average, adoption of BMPs increased
              depth-weighted SOC and MBC concentrations by 18 and 30 \%,
              respectively, relative to organically-managed control groups.
              Among BMPs, organic amendments and conservation tillage practices
              showed net positive effect on soil health with 24 and 14 \%
              increase in depth-weighted SOC concentrations, respectively.
              Although cover cropping did not have an overall influence on SOC
              concentrations, we found a temporal trend such that cover
              cropping significantly increased SOC concentrations after 5 years
              of its adoption. This indicates that the soil health benefits
              from BMPs accrue over time and highlights the need of long-term
              adoptability of BMPs to achieve agricultural sustainability.
              Future primary articles that focus on under-researched cropping
              practices in organic systems (e.g., crop rotation length and
              diversity, biochar addition) and the additive effects of multiple
              BMPs on soil health, will add to the synthesizable evidence base.
              Therefore, this meta-analysis confirms the soil health benefits
              of adopting BMPs within organic farming systems, identifies
              critical knowledge gaps, and provides directions for future
              organic farming research.",

              accessible guidelines for the authors of meta-analyses. We focus
              on meta-analyses using non-human species, which we term
              'biological' meta-analysis. Our ten questions are aimed at
              enabling a biologist to evaluate whether a biological

              reviews not only in medical and social sciences but also in
              biological sciences. Meta-analysis in biological sciences,
              especially in ecology and evolution (which we refer to as
              `biological' meta-analysis) faces somewhat different
              methodological problems from its counterparts in medical and
              social sciences, where meta-analytic techniques were originally
              developed. The main reason for such differences is that
              biological meta-analysis often integrates complex data composed
              of multiple strata with, for example, different measurements and
              a variety of species. Here, we review methodological issues and
              advancements in biological meta-analysis, focusing on three
              topics: (1) non-independence arising from multiple effect sizes
              obtained in single studies and from phylogenetic relatedness, (2)
              detecting and accounting for heterogeneity, and (3) identifying
              publication bias and measuring its impact. We show how the
              marriage between mixed-effects (hierarchical/multilevel) models
              and phylogenetic comparative methods has resolved most of the
              issues under discussion. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of
              across-study and within-study metaanalysis, and propose how the
              use of within-study meta-analysis can improve many empirical

              grown. Here, we answered the main question ``What are the impacts
              of microplastics on the functional traits of fish species?''
              through a meta-analysis. The general impact of microplastic
              exposure on the functional traits of fishes and specifically on
              eight variables, namely, behaviour, development, fecundity,
              feeding, growth, health, hatching and survival was explored.
              Subgroup analyses were performed to detect correlations between
              the impact of microplastics and the following factors: species,
              life stage, habitat, water column habitat, day of exposure to
              microplastics and microplastic size, type and shape. A
              meta-regression analysis allowed understanding the correlation
              between the impact of microplastics and the size of organisms.
              Generally, microplastics have a negative effect on the functional
              traits of fishes. Feeding and behaviour, followed by growth
              showed the greatest impact. Among the subgroup analysis, four of
              the eight variables considered showed a significant difference
              between groups: species, life stage, microplastic shape and days
              of exposure to microplastics. Depending on their life stage,
              organisms may be more sensitive to microplastic pollution.
              Changes in growth rates, development of early life stage and
              behavioural patterns in fishes may have a negative effect on the
              structure and functions of aquatic ecosystem in the long term and

              meta-analysis",
  author   = "Sohn, Julia A and Saha, Somidh and Bauhus, J{\"u}rgen",
  abstract = "Increasing frequency of extremely dry and hot summers in some
              regions emphasise the need for silvicultural approaches to
              increase the drought tolerance of existing forests in the short
              term, before long-term adaptation through species changes may be
              possible. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the
              potential of thinning for improving tree performance during and
              after drought. We used results from 23 experiments that employed
              different thinning intensities including an unthinned control and
              focused on the response variables: radial growth, carbon- and
              oxygen-isotopes in tree-rings and pre-dawn leaf-water potential.
              We found that thinning effects on the growth response to drought
              differed between broadleaves and conifers, although these
              findings are based on few studies only in broadleaved forests.
              Thinning helped to mitigate growth reductions during drought in
              broadleaves, most likely via increases of soil water
              availability. In contrast, in conifers, comparable
              drought-related growth reductions and increases of water-use
              efficiency were observed in all treatments but thinning improved
              the post-drought recovery and resilience of radial growth.
              Results of meta-regression analysis indicate that benefits of
              both moderate and heavy thinning for growth performance following
              drought (recovery and resilience) decrease with time since the
              last intervention. Further, growth resistance during drought
              became smaller with stand age while the rate of growth recovery
              following drought increased over time irrespective of treatment.
              Heavy but not moderate thinning helped to avoid an age-related
              decline in medium-term growth resilience to drought. For both
              closed and very open stands, growth performance during drought
              improved with increasing site aridity but for the same stands
              growth recovery and resilience following drought was reduced with
              increasing site aridity. This synthesis of experiments from a
              wide geographical range has demonstrated that thinning, in
              particular heavy thinning, is a suitable approach to improve the
              growth response of remaining trees to drought in both conifers
              and broadleaves but the underlying processes differ and need to
              be considered.",
