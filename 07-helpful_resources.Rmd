# Helpful resources

There are many other websites, books, and resources that exist to help researchers become more familiar with the different components of conducting a meta-analysis. We outline some of those resources here. As always, please reach out to us by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/robcrystalornelas/meta-analysis_of_ecological_data/issues) to suggest more resources for this page.

## References managers  
Reference managers help you organize the many PDFs you will surely have to read through when conducting a meta-analysis. They are programs or sometimes websites where you upload your PDFs, and then create sub-folders to help organize all those PDFs.  Even a highly organized Google Drive folder, at some point, becomes unwieldy doing the many stages of screening articles and extracting data. Once I locate potential articles for a systematic review or meta-analysis, I quickly move to doing most of the remaining article screening and reading from within my reference manager.  
There are many considerations you should take into account when choosing a reference manager including: price, integration with certain programs (e.g., Word, google docs), and whether your most frequent collaborators already have a preferred reference manager.
