## Motivation for this book {-}

We created this book as a guide to conducting meta-analysis using ecological data in R.  Ecologists are increasingly turning to evidence synthesis (i.e., systematic review and meta-analysis) as a way of describing and summarizing the published evidence base within sub-disciplines.  There are helpful books that provide the theory behind meta-research in ecology [@koricheva_handbook_2013]. There are also more technical guides that provide the R code for conducting meta-analyses, but these are typically built around datasets and methodology in medical [@schwarzer_meta-analysis_2015]or social sciences [@harrer_doing_2019]. We are excited to provide a guide for those conducting a meta-analysis in R using ecological data.  We present methods that we have used in our own research, and of course indicate where we have built upon the work of other meta-researchers regardless of their primary field of investigation.

## Intro to the data {-}

The data we use in this book come from a meta-analysis by one of the co-authors (RCO) and his PhD advisor Dr. Julie Lockwood [@crystal-ornelas_cumulative_2020]. The data are the result of a systematic search for articles that investigate how invasive species native species richness. Language is particularly important to the field of invasion ecology [@mattingly_disconnects_2020], and so we start by describing what we mean when we say **invasive species**. The dataset contains information from ??Articles on ?? species of invasive trees. These trees havebeen intentionally or unintentionally moved to a new location from their native location.  The invasive trees have established local populations, spread from this location and are now affecting their surrounding ecosystems in the new sites.

For more information about invasive species, we provide couple of references  the authors find helpful.
